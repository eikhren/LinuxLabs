  "title": "Fixing MTP Access Issues with Nemo on KDE Neon",
  "date": "2025-12-22",
  "context": "User was on KDE Neon 24.04 using Nemo File Manager and experienced 'Malformed URL mtp:udi=...' errors when connecting an Android phone for file transfer.",
  "category": "Linux Device Mounting",
  "keyIdea": "KDE uses KIO for device handling, while Nemo relies on GVFS. The error occurred because KDE handed off an MTP URL Nemo couldn't interpret. Installing GVFS backends and setting Nemo as the default file manager restored proper MTP functionality.",
  "commands": "sudo apt install gvfs-backends gvfs-fuse mtp-tools\nsystemctl --user restart gvfs-daemon.service\nxdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory application/x-directory",
  "explanation": "The issue arises from a mismatch between KDE's KIO subsystem and Nemo's GVFS backend. Installing GVFS packages enables MTP support under Nemo, and setting Nemo as the default file manager prevents KIOExec errors when opening devices.",
  "reusabilityNotes": {
    "whenToReuse": "Whenever a KDE-based system uses Nemo or another GTK file manager for device management and MTP devices fail to open.",
    "pitfalls": "Avoid removing KIO packages entirely—KDE still needs them for system integration. Always ensure the phone is in 'File Transfer (MTP)' mode and unlocked."
