  "title": "Set PolyMC Minecraft niceness to -10 via wrapper",
  "date": "2025-11-25",
  "context": "Configured Ubuntu 24.04 KDE Neon system so that Minecraft launched via PolyMC always runs with higher CPU scheduling priority.",
  "category": "System Administration",
  "keyIdea": "Instead of globally editing PATH, a custom Java wrapper script was created and set in PolyMC’s Java runtime path. This ensures Minecraft’s Java process always starts with nice -10, improving performance without affecting other programs.",
  "commands": "mkdir -p ~/.local/bin\nnano ~/.local/bin/java-mc\n# Paste wrapper content\n#!/bin/bash\nexec nice -n -10 /usr/lib/jvm/java-25-openjdk-amd64/bin/java \"$@\"\nchmod +x ~/.local/bin/java-mc\n# Then in PolyMC settings, set Java runtime path to this wrapper",
  "explanation": "PolyMC launches Minecraft via a specified Java executable. By replacing this with a wrapper that calls the real Java binary under a higher priority (nice -10), we gain finer control without changing system-wide PATH or affecting other applications.",
  "reusabilityNotes": {
    "whenToReuse": "When you want to raise process priority for a specific app launched through a runtime manager.",
    "pitfalls": "Ensure the wrapper path is executable and PolyMC points to it. Avoid using -20 without proper permissions; -10 is safe for users."
