  "title": "Hierarchical Breakdown of /usr and /var in Ubuntu 22.04",
  "date": "2025-11-19",
  "context": "Exploring how Ubuntu organizes user binaries, libraries, logs, and variable data across /usr and /var.",
  "category": "Tutorial / Concept",
  "keyIdea": "/usr contains mostly static executables and shared resources; /var holds variable data that changes during system operation. Understanding both is key for maintenance, backups, and troubleshooting.",
  "commands": "# Explore /usr and /var with depth 2\nsudo tree -L 2 /usr /var\n\n# Check disk usage per subdirectory\nsudo du -sh /usr/* /var/*\n\n# View service state directories\nls /var/lib | sort",
  "explanation": "/usr is read-mostly, standardized for all users and applications. /var is writable, containing transient and persistent data created by services. System administrators monitor /var/log and /var/lib closely for performance and state consistency.",
  "reusabilityNotes": {
    "whenToReuse": "When planning filesystem layouts, troubleshooting services, or cleaning up disk space.",
    "pitfalls": "Avoid deleting files in /var/lib or /var/spool directly—use service tools instead (e.g., systemctl, apt clean)."
