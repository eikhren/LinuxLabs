  "context": "Examining Ubuntu’s post-installation filesystem structure (with ownership and symlinks), and learning how to open a terminal with elevated privileges.",
  "category": "Tutorial / Concept",
  "keyIdea": "Ubuntu 22.04 uses a merged /usr structure with symlinks from /bin, /lib, and /sbin; ownership defaults to root:root. Root access should be obtained via sudo for individual commands or sudo -i for a shell session.",
  "commands": "# List root directories with symlinks and permissions\nsudo ls -ld /* | sort\n\n# Enter a temporary root shell\nsudo -i\n\n# Run individual commands with root privileges\nsudo <command>\n\n# Exit root shell\nexit",
  "explanation": "The merged /usr layout simplifies system management by unifying executable and library locations. Root ownership and permissions protect system integrity. sudo enables secure privilege escalation without persistent root login.",
  "reusabilityNotes": {
    "whenToReuse": "When auditing filesystem layouts, verifying permissions, or performing administrative tasks.",
    "pitfalls": "Avoid making global permission changes as root. Never run sudo commands that affect /proc, /sys, or /run unless you know the effect."
