  "date": "2025-12-02",
  "context": "User needed to push to both personal and organization GitHub repositories over HTTPS using separate Personal Access Tokens (PATs).",
  "category": "git",
  "keyIdea": "Store multiple GitHub tokens in ~/.git-credentials and distinguish them by adding 'username@' before github.com in each repo's remote URL, allowing Git to use the correct credentials automatically.",
  "commands": "git config --global credential.helper store\nnano ~/.git-credentials\n# Add lines:\n# https://mc-deltautils:github_pat_XXXX@github.com\n# https://eikhren:github_pat_YYYY@github.com\ngit remote set-url origin https://eikhren@github.com/eikhren/xhGen.git\ngit remote set-url origin https://mc-deltautils@github.com/mc-deltautils/<org-repo>.git\ngit fetch",
  "explanation": "By storing both tokens in ~/.git-credentials and prefixing each remote URL with the matching username (e.g., eikhren@github.com), Git treats each as a distinct credential entry, allowing you to push to both personal and organization repos without conflicts or re-authentication.",
  "reusabilityNotes": {
    "whenToReuse": "Whenever you need to work with multiple GitHub accounts or organizations using HTTPS tokens on the same machine.",
    "pitfalls": "Ensure you prefix each remote URL with the correct username@github.com, or Git will pick the wrong token. Avoid storing plaintext tokens on shared systems."
